# Dotfiles

These are very simple configurations mainly for use in GitHub Codespaces. It installs the [Homebrew Package Manager](https://brew.sh/) using the `install.sh` script, which is run automatically when the Codespace starts. This repository can also be used as regular dotfiles, but I have since moved to my [Nix configuration](https://github.com/andreshungbz/nixconfig).

The older version of this repository can be found in the branch list.
